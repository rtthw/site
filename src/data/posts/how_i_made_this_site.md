Rust comes packaged with a pretty great tool called [`rustdoc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html) that generates a static site based on the contents of your Rust crate. You can use this in conjunction with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a free static site hosting service, to host your own website without having to write a single line of JavaScript or HTML (if you don't want to).
