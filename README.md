The personal website for Matthew Martin.

## What's going on here?

This is an auto-generated website created using [`rustdoc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html), and hosted for free through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I chose to do it this way because I wanted to create a website for myself, but I am **not** a web developer. I can't stand JavaScript, tolerate HTML, and resent CSS. With this method, I can at least sleep soundly at night knowing I'm not a web developer.
